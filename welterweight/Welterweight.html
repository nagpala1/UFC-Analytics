				<p>A change of scenery since the GSP days, 170 no longer hosts the likes of Johnny Hendricks, Rory Macdonald, Nick Diaz and Hector Lombard in the top 10. Instead, a newer and perhaps fresher breed of fighters have risen to fill the voids left behind.</p>
				<li class="ww1">
					<h2>(C): Tyron Woodley</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">17-3:</span> After defeating the man many thought was an uncrowned king, Woodley has cemented his place as the best current welter weight in the world. He very well could hold the best for a long, long time..</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="ww2">
					<h2>1: Stephen Thompson</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">13-2:</span> He has already fought for the belt twice and came up short both times. So, what's next? The best thing Thompson can do for now is stay active and jump-start another win streak.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="ww3">
					<h2>2: Demian Maia</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">26-5:</span> One of the best submission artists in the UFC. The question is though, can Maia actually pose a challenge to the champ, who is nearly impossible to take down.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="ww4">
					<h2>3: Robbie Lawler</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">27-11:</span> Lawler has been in many wars over the past several years, so the time off after getting brutalized by Woodley is a very smart move.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="ww5">
					<h2>4: Jorge Masvidal</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">32-12:</span> Masvidal has a superior stand-up game and excellent wrestling defense. A title-shot in the near future is definitely a solid possibility.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="ww6">
					<h2>5: Neil Magny</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">19-5:</span> Magny's height - 6'3" - makes him the tallest welterweight on the roster. If he can learn to properly utilize his physical advantages on a consistent basis, he could become a legit title threat.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="ww7">
					<h2>6: Kelvin Gastelum</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">13-2:</span> Had it not been for poor dieting, many believe Gastelum would have already fought for the title. Better late than never.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="ww8">
					<h2>7: Carlos Condit</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">30-10:</span> Is Condit capable of a late career ressurection? Maybe he just needs to take some time off..</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="ww9">
					<h2>8: Donald Cerrone</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">32-8:</span> Cerrone has always been a top fighter throughout his career who has had a tendency to crack under the big spot-light.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="ww10">
					<h2>9: Dong Hyun Kim</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">22-3:</span> Currently riding a 3 fight win streak, Kim leaves little doubt that he is a top 10 welter weight. </p>
