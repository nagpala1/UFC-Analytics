				<p>A new king has been born, an old one has been replaced, and the rest has pretty much stayed the same. Even though he is no longer present, Mcgregor's finger prints are still all over this division..</p>
				<li class="fw1">
					<h2>(C): Max Holloway</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">17-3:</span> Holloway just gets better and better with each and every fight. Given his young age and willingness to compete, the 145 division may have it's new long-term king.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="fw2">
					<h2>1: Jose Aldo</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">26-3:</span> Losing 2 of his last 3 fights, Aldo's aura of invincibility is history. He is still miles above everyone else, but he definitely is not getting any younger.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="fw3">
					<h2>2: Frankie Edgar</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">21-5:</span> Clearly the third best fighter at 145, Edgar is bound to recieve the next title-shot. If he wins, his first title defense could be against Jose Aldo. Isn't that unfortunate..?</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="fw4">
					<h2>3: Ricardo Lamas</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">17-5:</span> Lamas has been in the top 5 for quite some time now. If all of the pieces fall in the right place, he just may recieve another title shot soon.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="fw5">
					<h2>4: Cub Swanson</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">25-7:</span> Swanson has a tendency to get hit.. a lot. Eventually, that chin is going to crack from all of the wear-and-tear it has recieved over the years.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="fw6">
					<h2>5: Chan Sung Jung</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">14-4:</span> There's a reason why Chan is called "Korean Zombie", and it's because he loves to get hit and keep moving forward. Entertaining yes, but can that win him a title?</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="fw7">
					<h2>6: Anthony Pettis</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">19-6:</span> No high-level fighter has looked worse since the USADA era than Anthony Pettis. Was he truly on 'PEDS', or is the competition he is facing now just too stiff?</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="fw8">
					<h2>7: Jeremy Stephens</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">25-13:</span> WHO THE FOOK IS THAT GUY?</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="fw9">
					<h2>8: Yair Rodriquez</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">11-2:</span> Flashy striker with a devastating kicking game. Other than that, Yair doesn't really offer much.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="fw10">
					<h2>9: Brian Ortega</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">11-0:</span> Unbeaten in his professional mixed-martial-arts career, Ortega could very well be the next big thing at 145.</p>
