				<p>The spectacular and most intriguing weight class in all of MMA, the heavyweight division is once again picking up some long-awaited momentum. Although the top contenders in the division have been nearly identical for the past several years, a ton of new meat is constantly being added onto the title picture. And the champ - the man who is deemed the baddest on the planet - appears to be here to stay for quite some time..</p>
				<li class="first">
					<h2>(C): Stipe Miocic</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">17-2:</span> 5 straight finishes and now 2 title defenses, Miocic is rapidly rising up the 'greatest heavyweight of all-time' list.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="second">
					<h2>1: Cain Velasquez</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">14-2:</span> His last lost stung, but what has hurt Cain the most during his career is his unability to stay healthy.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="third">
					<h2>2: Fabricio Werdum</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">21-6:</span> Perhaps the greatest BJJ practitioner in all of MMA, Werdum has had a stellar fighting career. At 39 years old though, his window of opportunity is vastly declining. </p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="fourth">
					<h2>3: Alistair Overeem</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">42-15:</span> Overeem is considered by many to be one of the most decorated strikers and physically imposing fighters in MMA history. If he can improve his striking defense, he can make one last push towards the title. </p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="fifth">
					<h2>4: Junior Dos Santos</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">18-5:</span> It's been an inconsistent, uphill battle for Dos Santos ever since the long-ago but not-forgotten beatings he suffered from Cain Velasquez. </p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="sixth">
					<h2>5: Francis Ngannou</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">10-1:</span> The scariest fighter on the roster, 'The Predator' has quickly risen up the rankings, and is on verge of a title shot in the near future.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="seventh">
					<h2>6: Derrick Lewis</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">18-4:</span> Whether or not he is a legit title contender remains to be seen, but what we do know for certain is that Lewis does not fail to put people in seats.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="eighth">
					<h2>7: Mark Hunt</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">12-11:</span> At first glace, Hunt may seem like your average overweight citizen. However, what lies beneath all of that flesh, flesh, and well, more flesh, is a beast with force capable of knocking out a bull.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="ninth">
					<h2>8: Andrei Arlovski</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">25-14:</span> Once a top 3 heavyweight in the world during his peak, Arlovski has been rather inconsistent during his UFC tenure. And now, having lost his last 4 fights in brutal fashion, the end seems to be approaching rather quickly for 'The Pit Bull'.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="tenth">
					<h2>9: Travis Browne</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">18-6:</span> Browne was a top 5 heavyweight a few years back, but those days appear to be long over.. </p>
					</div>
