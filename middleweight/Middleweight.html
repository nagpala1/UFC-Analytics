				<p>Once ruled by Anderson Silva, the middle weight division has officially moved on. With the current depth, talent and killer instinct at 185, it may be hard for many to take into account that the current champ is the same man who was once a mere gate keeper for many long years in a past, weaker era of middle weights. </p>
				<li class="mw1">
					<h2>(C): Michael Bisping</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">30-7:</span> Surprise surprise. Although his first title defense - 40-sum year old Dan Henderson - wasn't the most impressive, the victory will nonetheless help to establish his legacy.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="mw2">
					<h2>1: Yoel Romero</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">12-1:</span> Romero is the most athletic and explosive fighter currently in the UFC. His interim-title fight against Robert Whittaker in July could very well be the most intriguing match-up all year. </p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="mw3">
					<h2>2: Robert Whittaker</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">18-4:</span> Whittaker's aggressive striking game and excellent wrestling defense makes him one of the deadliest fighters at 185. </p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="mw4">
					<h2>3: Gegard Mousasi</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">42-6:</span> 5 straight victories have placed Mr. Mousasi amongst the very best middle weights in the world. He once lacked killer instinct, but that appears to no longer be the case.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="mw5">
					<h2>4: Luke Rockhold</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">15-3:</span> Luke has gone MIA since getting besmirched by Bisping in June of last year. His age, skill and fight IQ are all in favor of another title-run, but his desire and will to fight are not.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="mw6">
					<h2>5: Jacare Souza</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">24-5:</span> Jacare is a top middleweight, but age may finally be catching up with the old croc.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="mw7">
					<h2>6: Chris Weidman</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">13-2:</span> 2 years ago there were serious debates about who would win a potential match-up between Chris Weidman and Jon Jones. I think we all know how that fight would turn out now..</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="mw8">
					<h2>7: Kelvin Gastelum</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">13-2:</span> Is he a middle weight, or he is a welter weight? The fact is, Gastelum could be a top guy at both 185 and 170 if he can keep his eating habits in check.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="mw9">
					<h2>8: Anderson Silva</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">34-8:</span> The greatest middleweight of all time is still competing. At the age of 42, he is not only hanging around the top 10, but is beating some very good fighters in the process.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="mw10">
					<h2>9: Derek Brunson</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">16-5:</span> Once a promising contender, Derek has suffered 2 straight setbacks. What he needs more than anything is a little break from top-notch competition.</p>
