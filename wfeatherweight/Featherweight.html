				<p>The newly introduced women's division in the UFC lacks major depth, so we needed to include a few fighters who aren't currently in the UFC to make up for it. There is one fighter that is in the UFC however, that may just be the deadliest woman of them all..</p>
				<li class="wf1">
					<h2>(C): Germaine de Randamie</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">7-3:</span> Hard earned title, but did she beat Holly Holm fair and sqaure? </p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="wf2">
					<h2>1: Cristiane Cyborg Justino</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">17-1:</span> Considered by many across the globe, the best female fighter currently alive. The belt is as good as hers if she can stay out of trouble.. </p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="wf3">
					<h2>2: Megan Anderson</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">9-2:</span> Perhaps the one of only few female fighters that can truly challenge Cyborg. Too bad Megan isn't in the UFC.. yet.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="wf4">
					<h2>3: Julia Budd</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">10-2:</span> Another great featherweight contender whom isn't currently signed by the UFC. Budd is capable of doing some serious damage. </p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="wf5">
					<h2>4: Holly Holm</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">10-3:</span> Known as the one who dethroned Ronda Rousey, Holm is one of the more popular female athletes in the UFC. However, she must snap out of this funk..</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="wf6">
					<h2>5: Charmaine Tweet</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">9-6:</span> Tweet has only suffered 3 losses in the past 5 years, and they have all been to fighters that are ranked above her in these rankings.</p>
