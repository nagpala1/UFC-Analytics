				<p>The dominance of the champ gives out the illusion of the division being 'weak'. The statistics however, will prove otherwise. The best two are miles ahead of the rest, and the alpha is miles ahead of the beta.</p>
				<li class="f1">
					<h2>(C): Demetrious Johnson</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">26-2:</span> Perhaps the best to ever do it. His salary wouldn't be able to back up that claim though..</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="f2">
					<h2>1: Joseph Benavidez</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">25-4:</span> Easily the second best fighter in the division. No shame in that.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="f3">
					<h2>2: Henry Cejudo</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">10-2:</span> Cejudo is a dominant fighter who should stay in the top 5 for quite some time.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="f4">
					<h2>3: Ray Borg</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">11-2:</span> Borg is making a title push. While an excellent fighter, it does not appear he has the tools to cause much of a challenge to the current champ.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="f5">
					<h2>4: Wilson Reis</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">22-7:</span> Some believed Reis would be the one to dethrone the flyweight king. However, as evident by their recent fight, he simply wasn't.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="f6">
					<h2>5: Jussier Formiga</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">19-5:</span> Formiga is a very solid gatekeeper. In fact, everyone in the division - sans the champ - is a gatekeeper if you really think about it..</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="f7">
					<h2>6: Sergio Pettis</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">15-2:</span> Although he's not as dominant as his bigger brother once was, Sergio definitely is the better fighter between the two at the current moment, with a ton of potential still remaining.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="f8">
					<h2>7: Brandon Moreno</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">14-3:</span> Contender or pretender? Moreno's upcoming bout against Pettis will tell us all we need to know..</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="f9">
					<h2>8: Tim Elliott</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">15-7:</span> Elliot does not have enough to hang with the elite guys in the division.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="f10">
					<h2>9: Ian McCall</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">13-5:</span> Ian "Uncle Creepy" McCall is almost as bad of a fighter as his nickname. Jokes aside, most of his loses were to great fighters, so he's actually pretty solid.</p>
