				<p>Many intriguing fights remain to be seen in the year of 2017. The biggest questions have yet to be answered, and the moments we are all waiting are yet to materialize. Can Daniel Cormier formulate a successful gameplan against Jon Jones in the rematch? Will Conor Mcgregor ever defend a UFC title? Has Lawler's chin completely detriorated? The answers to all of these questions will be available to us soon. Until then, we'll just have to sit tight..</p>
				<li><ul>
					<h3>UFC Fight Night: June 10th - Derrick Lewis vs. Mark Hunt</h3> 
					<li class="first"></li>
					<li class="second"></li>
					<p> Goliath vs. Goliath. You hardly ever see these types of match-ups. Both are heavy hitters, both have questionable gas tanks, and both are able to successfully take a blow. Lewis is younger, hungrier and stronger. Look for him to make statement on June 10th, and keep the momentum swinging forward. <br /><br />
					<span>Prediction: Black Beast via round 1 (T)KO.</span></p>
				</ul></li>
				<li><ul>
					<h3>UFC 213: July 08 - Yoel Romero vs. Robert Whittaker</h3> 
					<li class="third"></li>
					<li class="fourth"></li>
					<p> Whittaker is young, fierce and deadly, and very well could be the best middleweight in the world right now. His combination of a devastating stand-up game and excellent wrestling defense make this a very tough fight for Romero. Add in the fact that he has a very well placed iron jaw, and this fight starts to shift in favour of the Australian.<br /><br />
					<span>Prediction: Whittaker via round 2 KO.</span></p>
				</ul></li>
				<li><ul>
					<h3>UFC 213: July 08 - Robbie Lawler vs. Donald Cerrone</h3> 
					<li class="fifth"></li>
					<li class="sixth"></li>
					<p> Robbie could be done for.. completely washed up after that agonizing knockout loss to Tyron Woodley. But then again, he may not be. The full year off will certainly help in the recovery, and we all know Cowboy's reluctancy against hard, heavy hitters. <br /><br />
					<span>Prediction: Lawler via round 3 (T)KO.</span></p>
				</ul></li>
				<li><ul>
					<h3>UFC 213: July 08 - Fabricio Werdum vs. Alistair Overeem</h3> 
					<li class="seventh"></li>
					<li class="eighth"></li>
					<p> Overeem is fighting as smart as he ever did, but so is Werdum. Both of these men have a devastating stand-up game, with the edge obviously belonging to Alistair. But while Overeem is savvy, he is no where near as good as Werdum on the ground. However, something tells me this fight is going to stay standing..  <br /><br />
					<span>Prediction: Overeem via round 1 KO.</span></p>
				</ul></li>
				<li><ul>
					<h3>UFC FIGHT NIGHT: July 22 - Chris Weidman vs. Kelvin Gastelum</h3> 
					<li class="nineth"></li>
					<li class="tenth"></li>
					<p> Weidman is in desperate need of a victory, and a bout against Kelvin Gastelum is not a fight you should take when placed in these circumstances. While Weidman may have the better wreslting, and is the bigger, taller man, Kelvin holds the advantage nearly everywhere else. Look for Gastelum to take over after a strong initial round 1 by the 'All American'.<br /><br />
					<span>Prediction: Gastelum via round 4 (T)KO.</span></p>
				</ul></li>
				<li><ul>
					<h3>UFC FIGHT NIGHT: 214 - Daniel Cormier vs. Jon Jones</h3> 
					<li class="b1"></li>
					<li class="b2"></li>
					<p> The fight we are all waiting for. The two best current lightheavy weights in the world. Expect it to play out similar to that of the first fight between these two. If Jon does not show any significant ring rust, he should be able to edge out a victory, just barely. <br /><br />
					<span>Prediction: Jones via 48-47 UD.</span></p>
