				<p>Barao was unbeatable, and then came along TJ Dillashaw. Dillashaw was unbeatable, but then returned Cruz. Cruz was back, healthy and better than ever, so who in the world was going to beat him? Surely the kid from Sacremento with the neck tats' wasn't going to do it, right? Ahhhh, but he did..</p>
				<li class="b1">
					<h2>(C): Cody Garbrandt</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">11-0:</span> One heck of a fighter, still undefeated, but his personality makes him extremely unlikeable to the general media. Is he ducking Dillashaw?</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="b2">
					<h2>1: Dominick Cruz</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">22-2:</span> It's unfortunate that Cruz was injured for the majority of his prime. While still great, you have got to wonder, just how many good years does he have left in him?</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="b3">
					<h2>2: TJ Dillashaw</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">15-3:</span> Dillashaw may be unlikeable, but he is cleary one of the top 3 fighters at bantamweight, and will stay in that echelon for quite some time. </p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="b4">
					<h2>3: Raphael Assuncao</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">25-5:</span> If this man can keep doing what he does best, then he is bound to recieve a title-shot eventually.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="b5">
					<h2>4: John Lineker</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">29-8:</span> An excellent fighter, but does he have enough to match-up against the very best in the division? His recent fight against TJ would tell us no.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="b6">
					<h2>5: Jimmie Rivera</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">20-1:</span> Rivera is riding a massive wave of momentum. His upcoming bout against Thomas Almeida shall answer a ton of unknowns about where he truly stands at 135.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="b7">
					<h2>6: John Dodson</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">20-8:</span> After failing to dethrone Mighty Mouse on multiple occassions, a move to 135 makes the most sense for Dodson. Still, it's not like it's any easier here..</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="b8">
					<h2>7: Bryan Caraway</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">21-8:</span> Caraway has been slowly rising up the bantamweight ladder over the past several years. He may be becoming more popular, but he will always be remembered as the one who dated Meisha Tate.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="b9">
					<h2>8: Aljamain Sterling</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">13-2:</span> Sterling has shown a great amount of potential but fails to put it all together every time the competition gets a bit more stiffer.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="b10">
					<h2>9: Thomas Almeida</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">21-1:</span> With an outstanding record at such a young age, Almeida is bound to become the next big thing at bantamweight. </p>
					</div>
