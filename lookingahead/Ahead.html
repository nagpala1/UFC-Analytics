			<h2>Fighter Salary</h2>
			<p> Considered the best MMA organization - in terms of competition - across the globe, the UFC is definitely the place to be at if you're a fighter, right? You'll get the most experience and become the best fighter and athlete you can possibly become if you were to compete in the UFC, right? </br>
			While these things may be true, can you really maximize your career - both in and out of the octagon - if you don't earn enough salary to pay your daily lifestyle needs?.</p>
			<h2>State of the UFC</h2>
			<p>There was a time many some years ago when the meaning of 'rankings' meant something significant. Those days may be well behind us now. Whether you're the top contender in the division, or the 5th, or maybe even the 10th, a shot at the title is far from guarenteed. What matters more now, is how much garbage you can talk and how marketable you are to the mainstream public.</br>
			There's no problem with this - the UFC is a business and is only aiming to maximize the potential earnings, just like any other business would. However, by going down this road of and degrading the meaning of rankings, the legitimacy of the UFC being a 'sport' is constantly in question.
			<h2>Sustainable Enterprise?</h2>
			<p>Can the degenerate attitude towards fighters, lesser pay-scale, and greater consistency of 'underserved title shots' lead to a long-term sustainable business?
