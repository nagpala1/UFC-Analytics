				<p>The division is packed with potential killers, but will all of that even matter if the "Notorious One" is out doing other things, such as delivering a baby or testing the waters in boxing? All we ask, all we want, is for him to defend a title..</p>
				<li class="lw1">
					<h2>(C): Conor Mcgregor</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">21-3:</span> The first champion in the UFC to hold to belts simultaneously. Who knows what he is going to do next. The casuals want to see him fight Mayweather, but the hardcores rather have him defend a belt..</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="lw2">
					<h2>1: Tony Ferguson</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">23-3:</span> Ferguson is a force to be reckoned with. Stylistically, "El Cucuy" is capable of causing problems for both Mcgregor and Khabib - the other 2 best 155ers in the UFC.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="lw3">
					<h2>2: Khabib Nurmagomedov</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">24-0:</span> Nobody doubts his great skill set and capabilites. What we all doubt is his ability to stay healthy. </p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="lw4">
					<h2>3: Edson Barboza</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">19-4:</span> One of the best strikers at 155, Barboza is a legit contender. The biggest question mark is his mental game. When he's on, he's tough to beat.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="lw5">
					<h2>4: Eddie Alvarez</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">28-5:</span> After getting embarrassed by the "Notorious One" and fighting to a DQ against an opponent ranked much lower, Eddie's time at the top of the divison may be over soon.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="lw6">
					<h2>5: Rafael Dos Anjos</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">25-9:</span> RDA was always a big lightweight. Moving up to 170 and testing the waters could perhaps there be the best move for his career at the moment.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="lw7">
					<h2>6: Nate Diaz</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">20-11:</span> Nate's fighting days may be over, especially if he is not able to secure a 3rd bout against Conor Mcgregor.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="lw8">
					<h2>7: Michael Johnson</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">18-11:</span> Johnson is good enough to beat the lower top-10, but not good enough to hang with the upper. He is a very good gatekeeper, but not much more.</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="lw9">
					<h2>8: Michael Chiesa</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">14-2:</span> Chiesa has shown major improvements in his game over his last several fights. The top-5 is within reach..</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="lw10">
					<h2>9: Dustin Poirier</h2>
					<div id="imageBox">
						<p><span class="record">21-5:</span> Poirier has not shown much evolution since the change to 155. He is a very solid top-10 fighter, and it appears that is all he ever will be.</p>
